# Simplest Blog

Create a blog by editing markdown files.

## See a Demo

1. Fork this repo
2. At command line:
  ```sh
  nvm use
  npm install
  npm run demo
  ```
3. This will copy `content-demo/` to `content/` and starts a development server that you can view in your browser. 
4. To create your own entries, edit the markdown files in `content/posts` and `content/pages` and then at the command line:   
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
